Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection.
Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both
arrays.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [23,3,1,2], nums2 = [6,2,4,23]
Output: [2,23]

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,1,1], nums2 = [1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,1,1]
