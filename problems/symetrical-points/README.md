# Symetrical Points

// There is a set of points with integer coordinates, e.g. (10; -3)
// input example (symmetrical): (-5; -4), (1; 9), (7; -4), (-6; 4), (8; 4), (-5; -4).
// input example (non symmetrical): (-5; -4), (1; 9), (7; -4), (8; 4), (-5; -4).
// output: true or false

// You need to determine if there is a line, parallel to y-axes, that split this set of points in such a way
// that those separated sets are symmetrical to each other relative to this line.
